# Visual Studio Solution

**Do not use solution folders.**

There are directory folders for the `src` and `tests` projects.

However, the C# projects are named so that test projects appear next to their corresponding source projects in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

**Solution File:** The repository uses `mealie.slnx`.
